%% Options for ruthesis class:

%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% projectreport: Project report (CS)
%% bachelors: Bachelor of Science thesis
%% masters: Master of Science thesis
%% doctorate: Doctor of Philosophy dissertation
%%
%%%%%%% CHOOSE ONE OF THESE %%%%%%
%%
%% draft: speed up processing by skipping graphics and adding useful
%%     information for editing.  Also sets spacing to double so that it is easier to
%%     write editing marks on paper copy.
%% proof:  proofreading version (final formatting with warnings)
%% final: generate document for submission, removing FIXMEs, and
%%     other markup.  Throw error if any fatal FIXMEs still in document.
%%
%%%%%%%% CHOOSE ANY COMBINATION OF THESE %%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% booklet: set the stock/font size for booklets (experimental, DO NOT USE)
%% forcegraphics: force graphics, etc. to be included, even in draft mode
%% debug:  writes more messages to the log file, adds debugging output
%%     and sizing boxes
%% miktex: disable some packages that cause problems for (older) MikTeX
%% icelandic: thesis is in Icelandic
%% oldstyle:  use the PhD headers and footers from the old CS template
%% online: for online versions (skip additional signature pages)
\documentclass[masters,forcegraphics,proof]{ruthesis}

%%%%%%% HACKS:  USE THESE ONLY IF INSTRUCTED TO DO SO!!!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% yngvihack:  Proposed changes to the template from Dean Yngvi
%\setboolean{yngvihack}{true}

%% Note, if you are writing a PhD thesis, it will be reduced at the
%% printers when it is bound into a book: B5 240x170mm (aka Programme
%% or Book economy) See the README.TXT for details.  Plan your figures
%% and diagrams for this size.  In a future release of this template,
%% setting booklet will allow you to see what it would look like.

%% For other thesis, print them out in A4, then they will be cut down
%% to 293x206mm by the binder.  Make sure you use "acid-free" paper or
%% the book will yellow and fall apart in a few years.
%% TODO: instructions to the printer about bleed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bibliography options %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% We suggest switching from bibtex to biblatex/biber because it is better able
%% to deal with Icelandic characters and other bibliography issues
%% As long as you use biblatex instead of bibtex by itself, it will at least
%%  generate a document without errors.
\usepackage[backend=biber,bibencoding=utf8,style=ieee, sorting=nty]{biblatex}
%\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}
% need to declare mapping for style=apa to alphabetize properly
% If you set backend=bibtex, it will use bibtex for processing (old way)
%    this can work with Icelandic characters, but you may get weird results.
%    bibtex does not know how to sort Þ and ð
% if you set backend=biber, you can use UTF8 characters such as Þ and
%     ð  but you will have to remember to switch from using bibtex to
%     biber in your client
% If you use JabRef, make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8 which is
%    not the default.

% Where is your reference library?
\addbibresource{references.bib}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CUSTOMIZATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% It is not recommended that you customize this file
%%   nor ruthesis.cls.   You should put your macros and packages into
%%   a separate file so that it is easier to use updates to the template.
%% The custom.tex file was created for this reason.
%% We load this much later so that it can overrite any existing settings
\InputIfExists{custom.tex}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INFORMATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
%% University information must be multilingual to deal with the
%%  required cover pages and abstract on thesis
%% NOTE: This may not be required for other reports!!!

%% Title in english and icelandic
%% This is required on Thesis, but not necessarily elsewhere.
%%
%% Note that title length is limited to what can fit in three lines in the inside page
%% Also note that the capitalization of the text on the front page is a potential source
%% of latex errors as it may not deal well with math, international letters,
%% and other latex constructs
%% Warning: capitalization does not always work anyway
\newML{Title}{Equivalence classes of mesh patterns with a dominating pattern}{Jafngildisflokkar möskvamynstra með ríkjandi mynstri}

%% If you have the title in just one language, put it into \setTitle{} directly e.g.
%%  \setTitle{Working Title}
%%
\setTitle{\MLTitle}
% \setTitle{Equivalence Classes of Mesh Patterns with a Dominating Pattern}
%% If you need to adjust the main title later, you can use
%% \setMainTitle{}
%% ***** Special Titles ******
%% If the title must be formatted specifically for the cover page or internal pages
%% (typically via line-breaks using the \newline command) then the following commands must be used
%%
%% This one for the online/PhD front page:
%%  and should usually be kept short per line
%% The template specified that a PhD cover should have the title in capitals, but
%%  the physical copies have not done this.  This macro is in case that
%%  turns out to be important
%\setTitleCover{\MLTITLE}
%% These two for the internal cover pages, usually not needed
%\newML{TitleInternal}{Internal Title}{Icelandic Internal Title}
%\setTitleInternal{\MLTitleInternal}

%% Author name (should be the same in any language, if not use \newML)
%% If you are writing a Project report with multiple authors, separate them with \\:
%% To keep the names typeset together, you want to use non-breaking spaces
%\author{Firstname1~Lastname1\\Firstname2~Lastname2}
\author{Murray~Tannock}

%% If the name must be formatted specifically for the signature page
%% (typically via line-breaks) then the following command must be used
%\setAuthorSignature{Student\\Name}
%% This macro adjusts the author name in the headers of the oldstyle formatting

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%INDEX SETUP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Indexes, and other auto-generated material
%% You will need two components:
%% 1) a program to extract the index entries and sort them
%% 2) LaTeX package to parse them

%% 1) Index generation programs: xindy, makeindex
%% Warning: makeindex and other traditional latex indexing
%%   does not know how to deal with accented characters
%% You will need to run this when you want to generate/update the index.
%%
%% For abbreviations, you may want to try
%%\usepackage[intoc]{nomencl} % intoc: In Table of Contents
%% remember to run:
%% makeindex filename.nlo  -s nomencl.ist -o filename.nls

%% 2) PICK ONE OF THESE INDEX PACKAGES: imakeidx, makeidx, index (is default)
%%  imakeidx does not need makeindex to be run seperately but
%%  it means that generating your document is slower when you are not updating the index
%\RequirePackage{imakeidx}
%\makeindex[intoc]  % add index to toc

\finalifforcegraphics{hyperref} %hyperlinks even in draft mode
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
%% !!!Must be the last package loaded except otherwise mentioned!!!!
%% \usepackage{hypcap}  %% puts link at top of figure, must be after hyperref

%%%%%%%%%%%%%GLOSSARY SETUP%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% A glossary is a nice thing to have in larger documents.
%% Unfortunately, it seems to cause problems on many TeX installations
%%  so it is disabled by default.
%% Uncomment the lines that start with \% in order to re-enable it

% % add an autogenerated glossary (separate from main index)
%% Warning: package glossaries doesn't like it when they are defined in the document
%% http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/glossaries/glossaries-user.html#sec%3adocdefs
%%
%% WARNING!  Memoir has an internal "index" option which conflicts with glossaries
%% Loading the package must go after hyperref (it is special).
% \RequirePackage[acronym,toc]{glossaries}
%% nomain: no main glossary
%% acronym: acronym glossary
%% toc: add entry in Table of Contents
%% automake: try to run makeindex using \write18 shell escape
%% without automake, run "makeglossaries" to process them
%% or the right makeindex options
% \newglossary[slg]{symbols}{sym}{sbl}{List of Symbols}
% \makeglossaries{}  % intitialize the glossary.  Must be in the main file!!!
% \input{glossary}  % load glossary definitions in preamble
